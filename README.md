# scissors

This script is created for taking fast screenshots and saving with ease. It is minimalistic and easy to use. It was created to eliminate (in standard Windows "Snipping tool") such actions as:
* Create New
* Save As
* Input name

## Usage
Download the .pyw file and open it with "python.exe". Now as it's launched you should see a program running in your taskbar named scissors.

Now just click and drag mouse over any area and release it. Dialog to save will be prompted. Hit "Enter" to save or "Esc" to decline. Screenshots are stored at "./screenshots/" located in current script's folder.
